- This information is helpful because it helps the company to be proactive and they can start thinking about the roles that need to prioritized to be filled.
- Under the mentorship_eligibility table provided we will be able to determine how many people are qualified for the mentorship program, which is ledd than the people that are retiring.
- This information will help the company think about ways of coming up with a program that will help make training for the new employees easier.

## Summary

To determine how many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact, we can create a query that shows the number of retirees and the age groups. This way the company can prepare and try to be proactive by trying to hire the amount of people that will be retiring.

There is not enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees, but that's why we created this analysis so changes can be made. We can create another query with the names of people retiring at the end of each year, that way the company can prepare and train new mentors and be ready for when the time for people to retire comes.
